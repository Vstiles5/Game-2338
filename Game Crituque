The game Little Nightmares is a very good and easy game to play. The create Tarsier Studios, there are now 
different kids that you can play as now, that you can buy as a add-on. The Game Little Nightmares a lot of
different areas that game testers must’ve looked and, and probably had difficulty playing, and looking at.

One thing that should have been addressed within the game, is the different playable kids being released at 
the same time, instead of months apart from each other. The jumping was a little delayed from when you would
hit the jump button. What could’ve been worked on the most is the difficulty of the levels, to add different 
difficulties, and keep it the same the whole game. The difficulty is really staggered out, some parts are easy, 
then you have the parts that you'll die on a lot, then like the ending, gets easy.
