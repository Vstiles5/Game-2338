I choose to play the game Prey, which was released in 2017 by Arkane Studios
when you start the game it gives you an option to choose between male or female, I chose the male.
The controls and the graphics seem alright. Its easy to control my character, and the game runs smoothly, but for some reason the game
does take a little to load, which is normal. I love the quality of the sound and game. 
The tests in the game were confusing at first, then it clicked on to why they were doing the tests. The game progressed really quick
from peacfull tp dangerous. There was danger in almost every room. The game creators sure do know how to keep a person on their feet the
whole time. It was fun and intense to play, form start to beginning. The sound and music most defficantly helped keeping it up.
