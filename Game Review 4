Angry Birds created by Rovio Entertainment, in 2009 it was one of the best mobile games back when it came out.
The main basis of the game is to catapult your birds through the level by destroying the items around you. In 
order to beat the level you need a certain number of points to get 1 to 3 stars. 
The game starts out simple, the it harder as the game goes on. You get so many amount of tries to beat the level, then 
You would have to start the game again. After a while the game can get boring, especially if you keep dying over and over 
again. They keep coming up with more games of this type, that is almost the same exact, but instead they change the birds 
up a little.
