#Game Review 6

The game lunaria story is a game tht was made around 2012 or 2013 by a chinese gaming site. It was then copied in to English version but R2Games
that is Lunaria Story. The game is is a simple sidescroller game that is a MMO game. The game did have a lot of bugs while playing it when i was a kid, 
and there was a lot of things that always went wrong, like copy right issues with one piece when a certain pet was released to the game.
Since then they did shut down the game, or at least i can no longer access the game at all.
To me the game felt like a whole rip off of Maple Story, which is why i think they got shut down for the copy right issues. 
It was a overall cruddy game to play but was very addicting to children, thats why i was addicted to the game.
