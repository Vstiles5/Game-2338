Being patient in testing games is probably a really good skill.
Another good skill to have is being very observent and quick to spot bugs. 

The hardest thing in being a game tester is keep your cool, because the games can be frustrating.

I learned that it takes so much time and effor in testing the game, and that there are goals.
THe most interesting part is basically trying to find ways to break the game.
