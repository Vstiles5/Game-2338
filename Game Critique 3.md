##Game 
* Red Dead Redemption 2
* Red Dead Redemption 2 was made by RockStar and released this year in October. It is a action-adventure type game. The main area that focused 
on was the main storyline. It took less time to just focus on the storyline than the rest, because there is just so much to do within the game.
I was mainly focusing on the running and the walking, and the horses movements, because they were a little off and glitchy. I love the rest 
of the animations, because they had a lot of details added to them. but just the transitions from standing to walking to running, even on
the horses seemed kind of lagged a little. These are just the small errors, and only thing I noticed wrong while playing the game again.
The game is overall good with everything else, and I didnt think there was much of anything wrong with the game, but then again I usaully
only play games for the storyline, and information in the game, so the storyline was great, others dislike the ending to it, but I am one of 
people who really did like how it was layed out.
