Game Review 
The Game Echo was Developed by Ultra Ultra, 2017 was the year it was released.
The game starts off very long, and doesnt really have much to it, and some parts look very poorly put, but then some 
parts have great detail an animations to it. 
The PC verson is very tedious to use, and its easy to forget what does what. Echo does have a lot of story
line to in it, and as well as talking. It gets very boring, and seems like a long time to even to get through the palace, 
bafore the power surges start happening. It took about 45 to 50 minutes to get through that part, as it is very confusing to 
get through.
The game has a lot of details going through the palace, as the game progresses it does get more difficult.
THe black outs whitin the game do happene a little too often, and get really tedious after a while.
The game was very good overall, and the amount of detail was great, and as well as the storyline.
