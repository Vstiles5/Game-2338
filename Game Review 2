The Last Gaurdian

The Last Gaurdian is about a kid whp escapes a tower with a giant beast name Trico, They both go through a journy to escape a tower.
The boy and guardian go through challenges and bosses to get out. 

The Gae was okay, it got irritating when the character would glitch, or the lighting would be too dark in areas.
